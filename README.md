# Musort
Musort: Effortlessly organize your music library with this Python3 program. Rename selected music/audio files in a folder using a customizable naming convention based on metadata (ID3) from the audio files. Ensure accurate metadata by using popular tools like MusicBrainz Picard, Beets, or EasyTAG before running Musort. Simplify your music organization and enhance file names for a more enjoyable library experience.

## Features

* Rename many audio files at once
* Rename audio files in subdirectories as well (recursive)
* Choose the naming convention (ex. track.title.flac or artist.track.year.mp3)
* Give a separator for the naming of the file (ex. track.title.flac or track_title.flac)
* Works on all systems that can run Python
* Supported audio formats  
  * MP3/MP2/MP1 (ID3 v1, v1.1, v2.2, v2.3+)
  * Wave/RIFF
  * OGG
  * OPUS
  * FLAC
  * WMA
  * MP4/M4A/M4B/M4R/M4V/ALAC/AAX/AAXC
  * AIFF/AIFF-C

## Dependencies
**Make sure to install these programs to be able to run Musort**
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker (Optional)](https://docker.com)

The Python3 library TinyTag is also used, but is already included in this repository. Therefore, there is no need to install TinyTag for only this project.

## Installation and Usage

### Method 1: Run installation script (Unix/Linux based OS only)

The installation script will move the python program to `~/.local/bin`. The installation directory can be changed in the `install.sh` script. **Note: The installation directory should be added to $PATH**
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/tdeerenberg/Musort.git
cd Musort
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
After that, simply use the command `musort` to use the program.
<hr>

### Method 2: Clone repo and run manually (All Operating Systems)

Clone the repository and run the Python program
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/tdeerenberg/Musort.git
cd Musort
pip install requirements.txt
```
After that, run the program with `python3 musort.py`.
<hr>

### Method 3: Docker installation

``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/tdeerenberg/Musort.git
cd Musort
docker build -t musort .
```
After the Docker installation/build is complete, Musort can be run with: 

`docker run --name musort --rm -v "[music_directory_host]:[music_directory_container]" -it musort [music_directory_container]`

The music folder must be mounted to the Docker container, therefore the `-v` option must be used to mount the directory.

An example of running Musort in Docker, using `/home/user/music` as music folder:

`docker run --name musort --rm -v '/home/user/music:/music' -it musort /music`
